        <h1>Pre-Colonial Period</h1>
        <i class="fas fa-campground icons"></i>
        <p>
          This time period was back when Filipinos were just tribal people and
          our literature was mainly based on oral traditions uninfluenced by
          outsiders.

        <p>
          This time period is around the time when the Americans pushed the

          This time period was around World War 2 when the Japanese occupied the

        <h1>Martial Law Period</h1>
        <i class="fas fa-ban icons"></i>
        <p>
          This period was around Ferdinand Marcos's reign. The country went
          through a lot of censorship and hardships. The media during this time
          period was fully censored.
        </p>

        <h1>Post-Martial Law Period</h1>
        <i class="fas fa-globe icons"></i>
        <p>
          This period was around the end of Marcos's dictatorship. Censorship
          was lifted and the freedom of expression, speech, and of the press
          were reinstituted. This was also around the time when the internet
          went through a surge of growth in interest to the Philippines.

        <h1>Question</h1>
        <p>
          "If you were given the chance to live in one of the periods in the
          evolution of the media in the Philippines, which period would you like
          to experience living in? Why?"
        </p>
        <h1>My Answer</h1>
        <p>
          Personally, I would definitely like to experience living in the
          post-martial law period. I think it would be quite fascinating to
          experience living at the start of the internet where there are many
          wonderful opportunities to be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to that, compared to the other time periods; The
          post-martial law period is also when our country is at the most
          peaceful state. So of course, I'd rather live in this time period when
          our risk of death is low.
