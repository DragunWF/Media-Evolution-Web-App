        <p>
          This time period was back when filipinos were just tribal people and
          our literature was mainly based on oral traditions uninfluenced by
          outsiders.

        <h1>Martial Law Period</h1>
        <i class="fas fa-ban icons"></i>
        <p>
          This period was around Ferdinand Marcos's reign. The country went
          through a lot of censorship and hardships. The media during this time
          period was fully censored.

        <h1>Post-Martial Law Period</h1>
        <i class="fas fa-globe icons"></i>
        <p>
          This period around the end of Marcos's dictatorship. Censorship was
          lifted and the freedom of speech and expression were reinstated. This
          was also around the time when the internet was first made available to
          the Philippines.

        <h1>Question</h1>
        <h2>
          "If you were given the chance to live in one of the periods in the
          evolution of the media in the Philippines, which period would you like
          to experience living in? Why?"
        </h2>
        <p>
          Personally, I would definitely like to experience living in the
          post-martial law period. In that time period, there's quite a lot of
          opportunity to be taken especially since it is during the time when
          the internet was first made available to our country.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my previous reason, compared to the other time periods;
          The post-martial law period is also when our country is at the most
          peaceful state. So of course, I'd rather live in this time period when
          our risk of death is at its lowest.
