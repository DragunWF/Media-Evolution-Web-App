# Performance Task #2 (Media Information Literacy)

## Instructions

### Directions:

Let us put your MIL to good use by studying major media evolution in the Philippines.

1. First, create a timeline of the evolution of the media in the Philippines
   from the Pre-colonial period, Spanish period, American period, Japanese period,
   Martial Law period, and post-Martial Law period. (NOTE: You may use the link below as a reference.)

2. Next, in your timeline, write a short description of each period.

3. Then, draw an "icon" that you think represents the specific period in
   the media evolution of the country.

4. Lastly, answer the question, "If you were given the chance to live in
   one of the periods in the evolution of the media in the Philippines, which
   period would you like to experience living in? Why?"
